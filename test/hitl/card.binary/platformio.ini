; The serial port used for streaming test results from the Swan to the host
; computer takes a second to show up after uploading. This script waits for it
; to show up before running the tests. See https://github.com/platformio/platformio-core/issues/3742.

; We need to pass this down to OpenOCD so that it uses the correct ST-LINK.
; In my (Hayden's) HIL setup, there are many ST-LINKs connected to the same
; machine. Simply specifying the serial port corresponding to a given ST-LINK
; via upload_port doesn't work, so we have to use the specific serial number
; of the ST-LINK we're trying to target.
